# Rock Paper Scissors Game

## Introduction

This is my simple front-end only web application to play rock paper scissors against a computer opponent. It features three gamemodes.

## Gameplay

Upon selecting a gamemode, you simply select rock, paper, or scissors to proceed. Its purely luck based, with the computer's logic being randomly generated.

In the gamemodes that allow an ending, there is a completion screen when point maximum is reached.

Lastly, there is an endless mode, where there is no point cap.
